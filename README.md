# Zerberus

Software for a robot, which chases racoons out of your garden.

It is build using the [4WD Wild Thumper Chassis with 34:1 gear](https://www.pololu.com/product/1566) and a Raspberry Pi 4B.

The software consists of several parts:

1. The motor control program which runs the motors is located in `/robot`.
2. A viewer/controller in `/frontend` folder.
3. An image recognition software located in `/image_recognition`.

The robot control program is implmented in TypeScript (for motor control) and Python (for image recognition).

## Installation

## Parts list

- [Wild Thumper (Chassis and Motors)](https://www.pololu.com/product/1566)
- Raspberry PI 4B
- [Motor Driver](https://www.handsontec.com/dataspecs/module/7A-160W%20motor%20control.pdf)
- Accumulator for Motors
- [CHOETECH PD18W Powerbank USB C 10000mAh for Raspi](https://www.choetech.com/product/b622-10000mah-5v-2.4a-portable-power-bank-black.html)
- [Maker Hawk 5MP Night Vision Camera](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B071718FDK/)
- [IMU with MPU 6050 chip](https://www.conrad.de/de/p/joy-it-mpu6050-beschleunigungs-sensor-1-st-passend-fuer-entwicklungskits-micro-bit-arduino-raspberry-pi-rock-pi-2136256.html)

### Wire motors, encoders and IMU

THe MPU needs to be connected to the I2C ports, motor controllers and encoders just need some GPIO ports. We wired them like this:

- MPU SDA <-> Raspi SDA (Pin 3)
- MPU SCL <-> Raspi SCL (Pin 5)
- Left Encoder A <-> Raspi GPIO 14 (Pin 8)
- Left Encoder B <-> Raspi GPIO 15 (Pin 10)
- Left Motor IN1 <-> Raspi GPIO 10 (Pin 19)
- Left Motor IN2 <-> Raspi GPIO 9 (Pin 21)
- Left Motor ENA <-> Raspi GPIO 4 (Pin 7)
- Right Encoder A <-> Raspi GPIO 19 (Pin 35)
- Right Encoder B <-> Raspi GPIO 26 (Pin 37)
- Right Motor IN1 <-> Raspi GPIO 17 (Pin 11)
- Right Motor IN2 <-> Raspi GPIO 27 (Pin 13)
- Right Motor ENA <-> Raspi GPIO 22 (Pin 15)

### Setup raspberry pi

- Install on SD Card by using [Rasperry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) with 64bit Raspberry Pi OS, using the options to pre-configure ssh and WLAN (see https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-bullseye-update-april-2022/)
- Put SD card into Raspi and boot, the Raspi should appear in your WLAN after a short while
- ssh into Raspi via its IP address with your pre-configured user and password: `ssh <username>@raspberrypi`
- Install required libraries: `sudo apt-get install pigpio git`
- `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash`
- Close and re-open your terminal
- `nvm install 18`
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jschirrmacher/zerberus.git`
- Go into cloned repository's folder: `cd zerberus`
- Install dependencies: `npm i`
- Enable I2C using `sudo raspi-config` (check that device is connected correctly by using `sudo apt-get install i2c-tools && sudo i2cdetect -y 1` - it should show a "68" between a lot of "--")
- Increase I2C baud rate by finding a `dtparam=i2c_arm=on` line in `/boot/config.txt` and replace it to `dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=100000`

#### Install image recognition software

- [Follow instructions to us PyTorch](https://mathinf.eu/pytorch/arm64/)
- Configure [PiWheels](https://www.piwheels.org/)
- Enable camera using `sudo raspi-config`
- `sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev caca-utils gfortran liblapack-dev libblas-dev`
- `sudo apt-get install cmake`
- `sudo apt-get install python3-scipy`
- `sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`
- `sudo pip3 install scipy`
- `sudo pip3 install scikit-build`
- `sudo pip3 install opencv-python`
- `sudo pip3 install scikit-image`

### Setup local Wifi network (experimental)

We use [RaspAP](https://raspap.com/) to have a local Wifi network on the Raspberry Pi, which is available
even when using the car outdoor.

Currently, we don't got the AP-STA-mode working, so that it is possible to have internet access as well, if the car is at home. This will be further investigated.

## Start

To run the production version which uses the actual GPIO and camera of the Raspi, run:

    npm run build
    npm start

Your user needs 'sudo' permissions to access the hardware. Normally, that is the case. If not, an error message will occur.

### Simulation mode

If you just want to test the motor control software on your local computer without actual motors connected, you can call

    npm run simulator

There are URLs for different use cases, which can be opened in your browser:

- [http://localhost:10000/](http://localhost:10000/) - The frontend with the remote controls.
- [http://localhost:10000/old/remote.html](http://localhost:10000/old/remote.html) - A remote control, which lets you directly control the car. This is especially useful for a smartphone used as the control device. In this case, replace the 'localhost' part in the URL by the actual IP address or hostname of the car. Put it on your home screen for easier access and to get rid of the browser controls.
- [http://localhost:10000/old](http://localhost:10000/old) - this older frontend contains a simple car control via arrow keys and space bar (for breaking) and a lot of information about GPIO state.

The older frontend also listens to the "t" key, which toggles route tracking. Tracked routes currently reside in CSV files on the server in `data/routes`. The name of each CSV file is the unix time stamp, the tracking was started. Each entry starts with the time in millseconds relative to this start time.

### Install to run at boot (experimental)

    sudo cp /home/pi/zerberus/zerberus.service /lib/systemd/system/
    sudo systemctl start zerberus.service 

## Development

If you change anything in `types.ts` (which is shared by server and frontend), be sure to run `npm run build:types` to update the transpiled version as well. The generated `frontend/types.js` file should be committed together with the changed `types.ts`.

### Log output

The log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`) can be set via environment variable "LOGLEVEL".

In log level `debug`, another environment variable, "DEBUG" controls, which modules are to be logged. This can be a comma separated list of module names in lower case, like in this example:

    export DEBUG=encoder,motor,car
